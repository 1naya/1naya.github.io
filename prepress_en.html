				Your file may not be ready for print. Let us show you the key features of a print-ready file.
			</span>
			<div style="border-bottom: thin solid orange;margin-bottom: -30px;">&nbsp;</div>
			<br><br><br><i class="bi bi-exclamation-diamond-fill"></i> Correct dimensions:<br><br>
			<span style="font-size: 20px;color: #3F3F3F;padding-left: 40px;display: block;"> Digital designers often overlook dimensions, thinking in pixels and providing a 2000px × 2000px JPG file. However, pixels are intended for digital platforms, leaving you uncertain about the appropriate size for printing. Guessing can lead to a final product that doesn't meet your expectations.</span>
			<br><i class="bi bi-exclamation-diamond-fill"></i> Correct file format:<br><br>
			<span style="font-size: 20px;color: #3F3F3F;padding-left: 40px;display: block;"> PDF is widely used for various print materials like posters, stickers, magazines, books, and even playing cards. Designers may give you formats like PSD or AI, which require extra preparation before printing and may result in additional charges at the printing shop. At our studio, we offer not only the original file format but also a print-ready PDF. For specific cases like using an EPSON T-shirt printer that accepts only PNG files, we include that too.</span>
			<br><i class="bi bi-exclamation-diamond-fill"></i> Correct bleed and trim marks:<br><br>
			<span style="font-size: 20px;color: #3F3F3F;padding-left: 40px;display: block;"> There's a high chance that your designer lacks knowledge of printing and may create files incorrectly. The file should include bleed and trim marks to indicate where the document should be trimmed after printing.</span>
			<br><i class="bi bi-exclamation-diamond-fill"></i> Correct color mode:<br><br>
			<span style="font-size: 20px;color: #3F3F3F;padding-left: 40px;display: block;"> For printing, the design file should be in CMYK color mode to ensure accurate color reproduction. RGB color mode is suitable for digital design. This is because monitors and printers perceive colors differently.</span>
			<br><i class="bi bi-exclamation-diamond-fill"></i> Correct resolution:<br><br>
			<span style="font-size: 20px;color: #3F3F3F;padding-left: 40px;display: block;"> Sometimes, your design looks great on-screen but appears blurry in actual print. Why does this happen? The file should always have a high resolution, at least 300 pixels per inch, to ensure a sharp and clear printed product.</span>
			<br><br><br>
			<span style="font-size: 36px;text-transform: uppercase;color: darkorange;padding-left: 40px;display: block;line-height: 48px;">Feeling overwhelmed? <br>Let us handle it for you!</span><br>

			<span style="font-family: 'Original Surfer', cursive; text-align: left;font-size: 1.5em;">TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br></span><br>
				
				- The Client agrees to pay 50% of the agreed-upon budget, for all graphics completed by the Designer. The budget covers all artwork and two revisions beyond the due date of the first draft design. Any additional work required after the due date will be billed at a rate of $40 per working hour, and only two more revisions will be given beyond the two allocated revisions. The Client must provide feedback within 48 hours upon receiving the draft designs for the allocated revisions.<br><br>

-The payment can be made via e-transfer (vincent.cui@hotmail.com) or cash.<br><br>

-If the Client fails to provide the final 50% of the budget, the final graphics and artwork will be withheld and not delivered.<br><br>

				
				
				
			- The Designer will provide the Client with design samples in PDF format for approval. All approvals must be made by the Client via email; approvals cannot be made in person or over the phone. It is the Client's responsibility to carefully review the design samples before approving them. The PDF may not show certain issues, such as color, resolution, or layout, when viewed at 100%. Therefore, the Client should zoom in on the PDF to review the design samples. The Designer is not liable for any errors that are not noticed by the Client, such as spelling, translation, image quality, color conversion from RGB to CMYK, color variation, font format, and other similar issues. It is the Client's responsibility to ensure that the design samples are accurate and suitable for their needs.<br><br>

- The Designer cannot guarantee color matching between digital proofs and the final printed product. The appearance of colors on a computer screen or mobile device may vary from the printed product. The Designer will make every effort to match the gradient density of each color, but the final appearance of a color cannot be guaranteed. The application of UV coating or lamination may also affect or change the appearance of printed colors. It is the Client's responsibility to review and approve the final product before distribution.<br><br>

- Orders can be cancelled upon the Client's request via email within 48 hours of placing the order, but may be subject to applicable cancellation charges. If the order is cancelled, any charges for labor hours (such as proofing or graphics design) or administrative fees (such as credit card fees) will be subtracted from the Client's refund. However, no refunds will be issued for any reason once the initial design layouts have been displayed to the Client. Design time is not refundable or transferable. If a deposit was required to reserve a specific date for a specific event, then the deposit will not be refundable.<br><br>

-The Designer relinquishes all rights to monetary gain or royalties for the graphics created after the agreed budget. However, the Designer retains the right to showcase all graphics created in a graphic design portfolio both online and offline.<br><br>

- The Designer warrants that they will only use legal and licensed software and materials and cannot be held liable for any monetary damages related to the agreed budget.<br><br>
- Inaya Creative Studio reserves the right to refuse service to any person, company, reseller, affiliate, or any third party without disclosing a reason, or to terminate any project prior to completion at any time and for any reason. The Client agrees that Inaya Creative Studio shall have no liability of any kind to them or to any third party arising from such refusal or termination.<br><br>
By accepting these terms and conditions, the Client acknowledges that they have read, understood, and agree to be bound by them. Any changes or amendments to these terms and conditions must be agreed upon in writing by both parties.
